# Vivian SARAZIN

I started my adventure in the web almost 10 years ago, by training myself in HTML & CSS via Codeacademy.

I professionalized my approach by becoming a web project manager at the end of my management studies.

After several detours in entrepreneurship and web marketing, I decided to seriously train myself in programming.

So I first integrated a first Web bootcamp @IronHack then a second one in Data Science @Le Wagon.

These skills acquired in different languages and frameworks allowed me to bring added value in many projects.

After many frameworks and languages, I decided to focus on Vue/Nuxt.
