# Vivian SARAZIN

I'm a web developer with over 6 years of experience leading technically demanding frontend projects. My journey began nearly a decade ago, when I taught myself HTML and CSS on Codecademy, which sparked a long-term passion for the web. I later formalized my path by becoming a web project manager at the end of my management studies.

After a few ventures into entrepreneurship and web marketing, I decided to deepen my technical expertise and enrolled in two intensive bootcamps: one in Web Development at IronHack, and another in Data Science at Le Wagon. This dual training gave me a strong foundation in a wide range of languages and frameworks, which I’ve applied across diverse and high-impact projects.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in modern frontend frameworks—primarily Vue/Nuxt and Svelte/SvelteKit—while also building solid experience with React, TypeScript, Node.js, and NestJS. I’ve led architectural redesigns, implemented testing strategies, and optimized both performance and delivery quality in high-stakes environments.

Beyond code, I thrive on collaboration and knowledge-sharing—as a tech lead, trainer, community facilitator, and contributor to open source. I'm passionate about learning, mentoring, and helping teams grow through structure and best practices. For me, every project is a new opportunity to elevate both the product and the people behind it.
